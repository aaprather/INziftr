-OLD PROJECT- (4/10/2015)

INziftr was programmed in C# and provided an easy to use GUI for pooler's CPUminer.

The CPUminer files are downloaded into a folder named 'temp_folder' in the directory that INziftr.exe is in.

Program was intended for mining crypto currency 'Ziftr Coin' - https://www.ziftrcoin.com/ 

This project is now discontinued!
